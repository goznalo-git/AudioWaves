# AudioWaves
Here you will find (hopefully soon) code providing a translation of .wav files to different possible visualizations, both static and dynamic (gifs), of the audio waves themselves or their spectrum. 

## But, why?

Why, you ask? Well, if you are interested in podcasting, as I am, but you still want to use Youtube as a broadcasting medium without all the hassle that video editing entails, you might want to upload something simple while visually engaging, rather than a static image. This is just an example, but I think the idea is clear: providing an open source solution for dynamical audio wave visualizations. 

And, of course, there are websites which already provide this service, but neither free nor as customizable as a Python script.

If you want to, feel free to contribute.
