# AudioWaves

Here you will find (hopefully soon) code providing a translation of .wav files to different possible visualizations, both static and dynamic (gifs), of the audio waves themselves or their spectrum.

## But, why?

Why, you ask? Well, if you are interested in podcasting, as I am, but you still want to use Youtube as a broadcasting medium without all the hassle that video editing entails, you might want to upload something simple while visually engaging, rather than a static image. This is just an example, but I think the idea is clear: providing an open source solution for dynamical audio wave visualizations.

And, of course, there are websites which already provide this service, but neither free nor as customizable as a Python script.

## Broad roadmap

1. Basics: properly understanding the problem at hand, both I/O and processing options. For that, use Jupyter.
2. Aesthetics: generate a few different styles to begin with. Also Jupyter.
3. Scripting: turn the Jupyter notebook into a script, with the options as user input.
4. Improvements

   - More styles, perhaps even using Seaborn over Matplotlib
   - Different exporting options (possibly video, avi/mp4)
   - Background static images

5. (Optional, long term) GUI: use PySimpleGUI to create a graphical application.
